## Nothing to Harvest (idea)

There's _Nothing to Harvest_ in your small desert home town, so you set out to
explore for seeds to bring back.

You take with you a small water cantil from the town's well that should last
about two full days.

You know nothing about the wildlife outside of your town, so you bring a small
notebook to write down new names for the plants you find, and hope to ask the
community eldests about them.

## Gameplay

* You have a limited supply of water, so you must be careful and stay close to
    visible water locations, or face the unknown risk of running out of water

* You want to harvest existing unknown plants you spot in the terrain to
    re-plant them back home. You can pick up many of the same kind.

* You can return home anytime. Every plant you bring back will award you one
    victory point. You win the game with at least 20 points. However, in
    neighbouring desert towns, friends of yours also set out to explore, and you
    desire to harvest even more plants than them. You can check the exploration
    "leaderboard" with the town elders (by simply visiting the town).

* There's nothing tracking you, so you must carefully remember
    your path back home.
